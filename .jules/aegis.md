# Aegis Learnings

## 2023-10-25
- **Task**: VanBasket Homepage Redesign.
- **Architectural Notes**: Replaced large monolithic `ProductDetail` usage on the homepage with a dedicated grid layout. Kept existing components like `TrustStrip` but refactored to act as a Specifications strip. Used placeholder text/images where required.
- **Vulnerabilities/Security**: No new endpoints or auth modifications were introduced. Build passes successfully.
